# R-Markdown-and-Leaflet
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

The rubric contains the following two questions:

1-Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?

2-Does the web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet?
