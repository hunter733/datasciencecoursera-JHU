# Statistical Inference Project on Central Limit Theorem and its Application to a Tooth Growth Dataset

This repo contains R code and R markdown documents for the 'Statistical Inference' course project,
as part of the data science specialization from Johns Hopkins through Coursera.

There are 2 parts to the course project
- The first part looks at the mean and variances of the exponential distribution and uses hist plots to
demonstrate the central limit theorem
- The second part applies concepts from the first part to analyse the tooth growth dataset, given in R
Using p-values we look to confirm or deny the null hypothesis in whether any of the independent variables
affect tooth growth
